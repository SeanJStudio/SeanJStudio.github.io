					<p class="description"><a href="dfuze/getting_started.html" target="_blank">Dfuze</a> is similar to an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) application. Except instead of
						loading data to a repository it allows you to export transformed data to various file formats to
						be used in other applications. See it in action <a href="dfuze/getting_started.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
						<br><br>
						My job involves digesting database files from many clients in a variety of formats and strtuctures. Clients often have all sorts 
						of database manipulation requests from algorithmically segmenting charity donors and their donation suggestions to identifying and removing
						records by comparing their names and addresses. Some tasks I have are simple yet repetitive or time consuming and some are out of scope of SQL queries. 
						This is all why I built Dfuze to to allow myself and coworkers of any background or experience to easily accomplish daily job duties.
						
						<br><br>
						Here are a few things you can do:
						<br>
					</p>
					<ol>
					<li>Combine multiple data files together (even of different file types or tables) into one database, merging 
					any fields with the same name together.</li>
					<li>Deduplicate names and addresses quickly and accurately.</li>
					<li>Regex pattern search an entire database while highlighting the matched parts.</li>
					<li>Map data to required fields automatically using string matching algorithms or saving them for future use.</li>
					<li>Export to many data formats and split the file based on values in the data.</li>
					<li>Merge and normalize disparate data sources.</li>
					<li>Easily automate tasks with programming templates.</li>
					</ol>
