						<a href="dfuze/getting_started.html" target="_blank">Dfuze</a> is an offline desktop application designed for B2B data onboarding, customer deduplication, and ETL. 
						See it in action <a href="dfuze/getting_started.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
						<br><br>
						I work for a mailing company that receives database files from clients in a variety of formats and structures. They are often riddled with user entry errors and require custom 
						data manipulation to be done. This means I'm responsible for handling an ever changing list of requests, from segmenting charity donors to identifying and 
						removing records based on name and address comparisons. Some of these tasks can be repetitive or time-consuming, while others require 
						solutions beyond traditional SQL queries. I knew I had to find a solution for this to not only be sustainable but also be improved which led to me developing Dfuze.
						<br><br>
						Some might say why not just use a pre-built on-boarding/ETL solution and I would agree with you. There were edge cases and scope creep everywhere like writing a memory effecient 
						Excel parser to rewriting the deduplication engine three times as I discovered new patterns and errors in addresses. I kept at it though and learned so much along the way giving
						me the confidence to tackle each new feature. The end result is now something that surpasses a pre-built solution with all the control at my finger tips. Its simplicity 
						has also enabled co-workers of mine of any skill level or background to provide a standard level of data excellence in their day to day.
						<br><br>
						Some of the key features of Dfuze include the ability to combine multiple data files (even of different file types or tables) into one 
						database, deduplicate names and addresses quickly and accurately, and regex pattern search an entire database while highlighting matched 
						parts. Dfuze also maps data to required fields automatically using string matching algorithms or saves selected ones for future use, 
						exports data to various formats, splits files based on data values, merges and normalizes disparate data sources, and automates tasks with 
						programming templates.
