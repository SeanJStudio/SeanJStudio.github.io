					<p class="description">I developed a utility application that provides several powerful features for working with PDFs. 
						The application was written in Java and built on the robust Apache PDFBox library.
						<br><br>
						One of the most exciting features of the application is its ability to extract text from PDFs using embedded methods or Tess OCR. 
						The video example on this page demonstrates how the software enables users to preview a PDF file and easily draw an area around a table 
						to extract the data as comma delimited text.
						<br><br>
						The application is highly versatile and can manipulate PDFs in many different ways. Some of my favorite features include extracting names 
						and addresses and breaking them down into their separate components as comma delimited data. The software can also extract tables as comma 
						delimited data, find and replace text with Regex patterns, interweave multiple PDFs and their pages, and even decrypt protected PDFs.
						<br><br>
						I am proud of the work I have done on this application and believe it can provide significant value to anyone who regularly works with PDFs.
