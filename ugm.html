					<p class="description">Union Gospel Mission is a charity that uses direct mail
						marketing to help raise money to help the homeless in Metro Vancouver. They were looking
						to do one of the largest campaigns of the year but needed strategy and direction. I processed and analyzed their
						donor data and past campaigns to bridge a connection to the most effective types of mail for their budget.
						<br><br>
						This has to be my favorite dashboard that I've ever made.
						I like how each section flows into the next and was so interactive.
						Users could hover over the different maps and symbols to see embedded sheets,
						change maps, and select and update their mailing quantities at the bottom.
						Please note for privacy reasons I have not embedded this dashboard.
