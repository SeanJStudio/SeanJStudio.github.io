					<p class="description">I had the opportunity to work with Union Gospel Mission, a charitable organization that 
						focuses on helping the homeless population in Metro Vancouver. My role involved analyzing their donor data and past campaigns 
						to provide strategic direction for their direct mail marketing campaign, which was one of their largest campaigns of the year.
						<br><br>
						Through my analysis, I was able to identify the most effective types of mail for their budget, allowing them to maximize their 
						resources and make a greater impact in the community. As a result, Union Gospel Mission was able to successfully reach their 
						fundraising goals and provide much-needed support to those experiencing homelessness.
						<br><br>
						One of the highlights of this project was creating a Tableau dashboard that allowed users to interact with the data in a user-friendly way. 
						The dashboard seamlessly flowed from one section to the next, and users could easily hover over different maps and symbols to access 
						embedded sheets, change maps, and select and update their mailing quantities. Unfortunately, for privacy reasons, I am unable to share 
						this dashboard on my portfolio website.
						<br><br>
						I am proud of the work I did for Union Gospel Mission and am excited to bring my skills and experience to new challenges and opportunities.
