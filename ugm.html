					<p class="description">I had the opportunity to work with Union Gospel Mission, a charitable organization that 
						focuses on helping the homeless population in Metro Vancouver. My role involved analyzing their donor data and past campaigns 
						to provide strategic direction for their direct mail marketing campaign, which was one of their largest campaigns of the year.
						<br><br>
						Through my analysis, I was able to identify the most effective types of mail for their budget, allowing them to maximize their 
						resources and make a greater impact in the community.
						<br><br>
						This is my favorite Tableau dashboard that I've created. I love how each section flows into the next and offers so much information and interactivity. 
						Unfortunately, for privacy reasons, I am unable to share this dashboard on my portfolio website.
