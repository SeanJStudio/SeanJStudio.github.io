					<p class="description">I had the opportunity to work with VGH Hometown Heroes on their popular annual lottery campaign. 
						My task was to analyze their donor data and past campaigns to unlock insights that could inform future direct mail 
						campaigns. By exploring the data, I was able to identify the most effective types of mail and bridge a connection between 
						their donors and campaign strategy.
						<br><br>
						One of the highlights of this project was creating a visually striking dashboard that allowed for easy navigation and 
						analysis of the data. The dashboard features a dropdown menu that allows for quick switching between different views. 
						Please note that, for privacy reasons, I have not embedded this dashboard on my portfolio website.
